# SpotCheck: Real-time Parking Spot Detection

SpotCheck is an advanced AI-powered system designed for real-time detection and monitoring of parking space occupancy. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, SpotCheck automates the process of identifying empty and occupied parking spots, providing valuable insights for efficient parking management in urban environments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** SpotCheck continuously analyzes live video feeds from parking lots to provide up-to-date information on parking spot availability.
  
- **Dynamic Visualization:** The system overlays bounding boxes around detected vehicles, offering visual feedback on spot occupancy directly on the video stream.
  
- **Accurate Counting:** Utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model, SpotCheck accurately counts and updates the number of available and occupied parking spots in real-time.
